#this is a multiline comment
# in python programming
# and it can be used to explain the code and for readability 

"""
This is another multiline comment in python
it is a literal string and it is not assigned to any variable
python will therefore ignore it
"""
#python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line
#Note: Make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you will get an error
z,r,q = "orange", "banana", "melon"
print(z)
print(r)
print(q)

#You can also assign a single value to multiple variables in one line as below
a = b = c = "fish"
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
